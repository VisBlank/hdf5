New Features
============

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Cmakehdf5: added ability to run multiple make commands.
      Added option --njobs to specific up to homw many jobs to launch during
      build (cmamke) and testing (ctest).
      (AKC, 2015/12/13, HDFFV-9612)

    - Cmakehdf5: added --with-szlib to support szip library support; and
      --enable/disable-verbose to display all cmake process output.
      (AKC, 2015/11/16, HDFFV-8932 and DAILYTEST-195)

    - CMake minimum is now 3.1.0. (ADB 2015/11/14)

    - Large file system (LFS) support has changed in the autotools

      * We assume that fseeko and ftello exist.

      * The *64 I/O functions and types are no longer explicitly used.
        We now rely on a mapping provided by _FILE_OFFSET_BITS (or its
        equivalent).

      * _LARGEFILE(64)_SOURCE is no longer exposed via AM_CPPFLAGS.

Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.16
===========================

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Updated Linux language level flags to match the Autotools. Removed
      Linux-specific flags from OS X.

      An addition to the flags simply being out of sync with the Autotools,
      the Linux flags were used on OS X builds which led to symbols not being
      found. Although this was non-fatal and compilation continued (implicit
      definitions were used by the compiler and the symbols resolved at link
      time), a large number of warnings were raised.

      Linux changes:

      * CHANGED:    _POSIX_C_SOURCE (from 199605 to 200112L)
      * ADDED:      _GNU_SOURCE
      * REMOVED:    _BSD_SOURCE
      * REMOVED:    _DEFAULT_SOURCE

      (DER, 2015/12/08, HDFFV-9627)

    - The --enable-clear-file-buffers configure option was non-functional so
      the feature was always enabled (its default value).

      Regardless of the configure flag, the setting was always enabled when
      the autotools were used to configure HDF5. This was due to the "no"
      option being processed after the "*" option in configure.ac so "*"
      matched first. CMake was unaffected.

      The option now works correctly.

      NOTE that builders are always advised to leave this option enabled.
      When disabled, buffers that are written to disk may contain the
      memory's previous contents, which may include secure information.
      The performance overhead of the feature (a single memset call per
      allocation) is minimal.

      (DER, 2016/02/03, HDFFV-9676)

    Library
    -------
    - Fixed some format string warnings that prevent compiling with
      -Werror=format-security on gcc.

      These only appeared in error messages and would not cause problems
      under normal operation.

      (DER, 2016/01/13, HDFFV-9640)

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - None

    Performance
    -------------
    - None

    Tools
    -----
    - h5dump subsetting fixed for dims greater then two.

      When a dataset has more then two dimensions, subsetting would incorrectly
      calculate the data that needed to be displayed.
      Added in block and stride calculation that account for dimensions greater
      then two.  NOTE: lines that have line breaks inserted because of display
      length calculations, may have index info that is incorrect until the next
      dimension break.

      (ADB, 2016/03/07, HDFFV-9698)

    - h5dump issue with argument segfault.

      When an argument with an optional value was at the end of the command line
      with a value, h5dump would crash. Reworked check for remaining arguments.

      (ADB, 2016/03/07, HDFFV-9570)

    - h5dump issue with default fill value.

      Added all default cases of fill value to display of fill value..

      (ADB, 2016/03/07, HDFFV-9241)

    Fortran API
    ------------
    - None

    C++ API
    ------
    - The member function AbstractDs::getArrayType() caused failure in user's
      program.

      This problem was caused by missing initialization of the ArrayType's
      members.  The problem is now fixed.

Known Problems
==============
* On windows platforms in debug configurations, the VFD flush1 tests will fail
  with the split and multi VFD drivers. These tests will display a modal debug
  dialog which must be answered or wait for the test timeout to expire.
  (ADB - 2014/06/23 - HDFFV-8851)

* CLANG compiler with the options -fcatch-undefined-behavior and -ftrapv
  catches some undefined behavior in the alignment algorithm of the macro DETECT_I
  in H5detect.c (Issue 8147).  Since the algorithm is trying to detect the alignment
  of integers, ideally the flag -fcatch-undefined-behavior shouldn't to be used for
  H5detect.c. In the future, we can separate flags for H5detect.c from the rest of
  the library. (SLU - 2013/10/16)

* Make provided by Solaris fails in "make check". Solaris users should use
  gmake to build and install the HDF5 software. (AKC - 2013/10/08 - HDFFV-8534)

* The C++ and FORTRAN bindings are not currently working on FreeBSD with the
  native release 8.2 compilers (4.2.1), but are working with gcc 4.6 from the
  ports (and probably gcc releases after that).
  (QAK - 2012/10/19)

* The following h5dump test case fails in BG/P machines (and potentially other
  machines that use a command script to launch executables):

   h5dump --no-compact-subset -d "AHFINDERDIRECT::ah_centroid_t[0] it=0 tl=0"
     tno-subset.h5

  This is due to the embedded spaces in the dataset name being interpreted
  by the command script launcher as meta-characters, thus passing three
  arguments to h5dump's -d flag. The command passes if run by hand, just
  not via the test script.
  (AKC - 2012/05/03)

* The STDIO VFD does not work on some architectures, possibly due to 32/64
  bit or large file issues.  The basic STDIO VFD test is known to fail on
  64-bit SunOS 5.10 on SPARC when built with -m64 and 32-bit OS X/Darwin
  10.7.0.  The STDIO VFD test has been disabled while we investigate and
  a fix should appear in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-8235)

* h5diff can report inconsistent results when comparing datasets of enum type
  that contain invalid values.  This is due to how enum types are handled in
  the library and will be addressed in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-7527)

* The links test can fail under the stdio VFD due to some issues with external
  links.  This will be investigated and fixed in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-7768)

* After the shared library support was fixed for some bugs, it was discovered
  that "make prefix=XXX install" no longer works for shared libraries. It
  still works correctly for static libraries. Therefore, if you want to
  install the HDF5 shared libraries in a location such as /usr/local/hdf5,
  you need to specify the location via the --prefix option during configure
  time. E.g, ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5 ...
  (AKC - 2011/05/07 - HDFFV-7583)

* The parallel test, t_shapesame, in testpar/, may run for a long time and may
  be terminated by the alarm signal.  If that happens, one can increase the
  alarm seconds (default is 1200 seconds = 20 minutes) by setting the
  environment variable, $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS, to a larger value such as 3600
  (60 minutes).  Note that the t_shapesame test may fail in some systems
  (see the "While working on the 1.8.6 release..." problem below).  If
  it does, it will waste more time if $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS is set
  to a larger value.
  (AKC - 2011/05/07)

* Shared Fortran libraries are not quite working on AIX. While they are
  generated when --enable-shared is specified, the fortran and hl/fortran
  tests fail. the issue. HL and C++ shared libraries should now be
  working as intended, however.
  (MAM - 2011/04/20)

* While working on the 1.8.6 release of HDF5, a bug was discovered that can
  occur when reading from a dataset in parallel shortly after it has been
  written to collectively. The issue was exposed by a new test in the parallel
  HDF5 test suite, but had existed before that. We believe the problem lies with
  certain MPI implementations and/or file systems.

  We have provided a pure MPI test program, as well as a standalone HDF5
  program, that can be used to determine if this is an issue on your system.
  They should be run across multiple nodes with a varying number of processes.
  These programs can be found at:

* All the VFL drivers aren't backward compatible.  In H5FDpublic.h, the
  structure H5FD_class_t changed in 1.8.  There is new parameter added to
  get_eoa and set_eoa callback functions.  A new callback function
  get_type_map was added in.  The public function H5FDrealloc was taken
  out in 1.8.  The problem only happens when users define their own driver
  for 1.6 and try to plug in 1.8 library.  Because there's only one user
  complaining about it, we (Elena, Quincey, and I) decided to leave it as
  it is (see bug report #1279).  Quincey will make a plan for 1.10.
  (SLU - 2010/02/02)

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag will only statically link libraries
  if the static version of that library is present. If only the shared version
  of a library exists (i.e., most system libraries on Solaris, AIX, and Mac,
  for example, only have shared versions), the flag should still result in a
  successful compilation, but note that the installed executables will not be
  fully static. Thus, the only guarantee on these systems is that the
  executable is statically linked with just the HDF5 library.
  (MAM - 2009/11/04)

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.
