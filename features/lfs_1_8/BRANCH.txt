HDF5 large file support (LFS) update branch

Created by Dana Robinson in December 2015. I am the only person
working on this branch.

This branch is for updating the scheme we use to handle large file
support on POSIX systems, primarily Linux.

This branch tracks the branches/hdf5_1_8 branch. It will be deleted
when the LFS changes are merged into the 1.8 branch and the trunk.
